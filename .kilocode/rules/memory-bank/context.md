# Current Context

## Work Focus
The Memory Bank for Hex Brains has been initialized with core documentation files. Current focus is verifying accuracy, refining contents based on user feedback, and planning expansions such as additional documentation and testing.

## Recent Changes
- Analyzed project structure using semantic search and code definition listing across engine and GUI crates.
- Created product.md detailing project purpose, problems solved, functionality, and UX goals.
- Created architecture.md documenting system design, component relationships, and key implementation paths.
- Created tech.md outlining technologies, dependencies, development setup, and constraints.
- Confirmed existing brief.md aligns with project as an evolutionary simulation engine using Bevy ECS for snake agents in a hex grid world.

## Next Steps
- Verify memory bank contents with user for accuracy and completeness.
- Expand project documentation (e.g., update README.md with setup instructions and examples).
- Consider adding unit and integration tests for core systems (e.g., neural evolution, simulation steps).
- Explore additional memory bank files if needed (e.g., tasks.md for repetitive workflows).
